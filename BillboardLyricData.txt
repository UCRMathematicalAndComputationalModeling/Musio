hot-holiday-songs	All I Want For Christmas Is You	Mariah Carey	29	1	12/24/2016	"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own

That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?

Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Well, your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya

She tied you to the kitchen chair

Snowin' and blowin' up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away

Sometimes you lose some
And right now
Right now I'm losing bad

I've stood on this stage
Night after night
Reminding the broken
It'll be alright
But right now
Oh right now I just can't

It's easy to sing
When there's nothing to bring me down
But what will I say
When I'm held to the flame
Like I am right now

I know You're able
And I know You can
Save through the fire
With Your mighty hand
But even if You don't
My hope is You alone

Now I'm hopelessly devoted

An army of hope, bringing the world a radiant light

Got braids in her hair
First time I seen her walk by
Man I ‘Bout fell up out my chair

Took me like 6 weeks

Body like a back road
Could drive it with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
Doin' fifteen in a thirty
I ain't in no hurry
I'm a take it slow just as fast as I can

The way she fit in them blue jeans
She don't need no belt

And by the way, loosin' up its pay day

Pour it up, have the time of your life

Makes time stall

I'd poison ""never,"" shoot goodbye
Beat ""regret"" when I felt I had the nerve
Yeah, I'd pound ""fear"" to a pile of sand
Choke ""lonely"" out with my bare hands
I'd hang ""hate"" so that it can't be heard
If I could only kill a word

I'd take ""brokeness"" out back
And break ""heartbreak,"" stand there and laugh
Right in its face while shootin' it the bird
I'd put ""upset"" down in its place
I'd squeeze the life out of ""disgrace""
Lay ""over"" under six cold feet of dirt

Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic.

I wish it wasn't 4 AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

country-songs	How I'll Always Be	Tim McGraw	24	9	12/31/2016	"I'm a little more beer bottle beer joint than a fancy bar
I'm a little more sitting up high on the road than a little car
I'm a little more bust ya back than take it for free
And that's how I'll always be
I'm a little more lose my temper than to sit on back
I'm a little more ol' Hank Williams than that trendy crap
I love a flat wood ol' front porch made of an old oak tree
And that's how I'll always be

I'll always be a fan of ol' stray dogs and guitars playin'
One room churches, back road walks and front porch swingin'
Sunset skies, bonfire nights, I love the simple things

Than loving a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic.

I wish it wasn't 4 AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A Better Man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute

Sixty seconds now feels more like thirty
Tick-tock, won't stop, around it goes

You're trying to make the good times last as long as you can

No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that
Ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth
You gotta go straight to the source

Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay ‘til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' ‘round
Tryin' to drown the thought of you

In a long time
'Till I bumped into some of your friends
Over there talkin' to mine

Then you roll in with your hair in the wind

I think you're too soon to call us old
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

And every time I let you leave
I always saw you coming back to me
When and where did we go cold?
I thought I had you on hold

Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to?
You've got the body, you've got the body
Dare me to, dare me to
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to?
You've got the body, you've got the body
I thought I had you on hold
Where does it stop, where does it stop
Where do you dare me to?
You've got the body, you've got the body

Am I out of my mind?
If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say
Don't matter what you do
I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Maybe we have made her blind

So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

Oh, I'm in love with your body

pop-songs	Scars To Your Beautiful	Alessia Cara	22	3	1/14/2017	"She just wants to be, beautiful
She goes, unnoticed she knows, no limits
She craves, attention she praises, an image
She prays to be, sculpted by the sculptor
Oh, she don't see, the light that's shining
Deeper than the eyes can find it
Maybe we have made her blind
So she tries to cover up her pain, and cut her woes away
Cause covergirls don't cry, after their face is made

But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark
You should know you're beautiful just the way you are
And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,
we're stars and we're beautiful
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh,
oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

And you don't have to change a thing
The world could change it's heart
No scars to your beautiful,

4 years, no calls
Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar and
I-I-I can't stop
No, I-I-I can't stop

So, baby, pull me closer
In the back seat of your Rover
That I know you can't afford
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder

Pull the sheets right off the corner
Of that mattress that you stole
From your roommate back in Boulder

Take my hand, stop
Put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox

And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me

Say: ""Boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me""
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new

pop-songs	I Don't Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker)	Zayn / Taylor Swift	14	2	3/18/2017	"Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy, up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

pop-songs	Paris	The Chainsmokers	9	5	3/18/2017	"We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
And I thought: ""Wow, if I could take this in a shot right now
I don't think that we could work this out""

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair
But I thought: ""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet

And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore

Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart

Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Won't you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?

I drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy

While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss

Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

If you only knew the bad things I like
Don't think that I can explain it
What can I say, it's complicated
Don't matter what you say

I only wanna do bad things to you
So good, that you can't explain it
What can I say, it's complicated

Nothing's that bad
If it feels good
So you come back
Like I knew you would
And we're both wild
And the night's young
And you're my drug
Breathe you in 'til my face numb
Drop it down to that bass drum
I got what you dream about
Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever
Even when we're not together
Scars on my body I can look at you whenever

Don't owe nobody, owe nobody
Always on the fuckin' job, I got no hobbies
Got the city fuckin' with me cause I'm homegrown
Vibin' out more than my phone though
Leave me ‘lone, me on my own though
Look, I cut that bitch off like an edit
My daddy a G, it's genetics (Straight up)
I heard ya new shit, it's pathetic
Ya contract should be s-shredded
Took my dogs on a private jet from the public housing
I kept it G, yeah, one thousand
Clique star studded like the Paramount mountain
Everything I do is righteous
Betting on me is the right risk
Even in a fucking crisis
I'm never on some switching sides shit
I switch gears to the night shift
Blacking out cause I'm enlightened
God talk to me in silence

While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life

Why we keep coming back for more

Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight

I don't think that we could work this out""

Out on the terrace
I don't know if it's fair
But I thought: ""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

We were staying in Paris
To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet

latin-songs	Duele El Corazon	Enrique Iglesias Featuring Wisin	36	10	12/31/2016	"Solo en tu boca
Yo quiero acabar
Todos esos besos
Que te quiero dar
A mí no me importa
Que duermas con él
Porque sé que sueñas
Con poderme ver
Mujer qué vas a hacer
Decídete pa' ver
Si te quedas o te vas
Sino no me busques más

Si te vas yo también me voy
Si me das yo también te doy
Mi amor
Bailamos hasta las diez
Hasta que duelan los pies

Si te vas yo también me voy
Si me das yo también te doy
Mi amor
Bailamos hasta las diez
Hasta que duelan los pies

Con él te duele el corazón
Y conmigo te duelen los pies
Con él te duele el corazón
Y conmigo te duelen los pies

Solo con un beso
Yo te haría acabar

latin-songs	Dile Que Tu Me Quieres	Ozuna	16	11	12/31/2016	"Yo sé que tu padres
No te quieren conmigo
No sé si será por mis tatuajes
O la forma en que yo vivo

Dile que tú me quieres
Que no le haga caso a lo que le digan
Nos vivimos enamorando día a día
Dile que yo soy el que te quiere
Explícale lo que sucedió
Entre tú y yo la llama se encendió
No sé cómo paso
Dile que tú me quieres
Que no le haga caso a lo que le digan
Nos vivimos enamorando día a día
Vida mía

Ya no quiero ocultarlo quiero tenerte cerca
Hablo con tu madre aunque sé que es difícil de convencerla
Que no se deje llevar por las apariencias
Porque mi corazón siempre te trata con decencia

Tú más que nadie sabe
Como yo soy contigo
No importa mi estilo de vida
Tu me quieres asi

Tú más que nadie sabe
Como yo soy contigo

latin-songs	Despacito	Luis Fonsi Featuring Daddy Yankee	8	1	3/18/2017	"Ay
Fonsi, DY
Oh, oh no, oh no (ey)
Hey, yeah, diri-diri-diriridi, Daddy, go!

Sí, sabes que ya llevo un rato mirándote
Tengo que bailar contigo hoy
Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino, que yo voy

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Sólo con pensarlo, se acelera el pulso

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo

Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito

latin-songs	Chantaje	Shakira Featuring Maluma	19	2	3/18/2017	"Hola, mírame
Ho-hola, mírame
Pig Floyd

Cuando estás bien, te alejas de mí
Te sientes sola, y siempre estoy ahí
Es una guerra de toma y dame
Pues dame de eso que tiene' ahí

Oye, baby, no seas mala
No me dejes con las ganas
Se escucha en la calle que ya no me quieres
Ven y dímelo en la cara

Pregúntale a quien tú quieras
Vida, te juro que eso no es así
Yo nunca tuve una mala intención
Yo nunca quise burlarme de ti

Conmigo ves, nunca se sabe
Un día digo que no y otro que sí
Yo soy masoquista
Con mi cuerpo un egoísta

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Siempre es a tu manera
Yo te quiero aunque no quiera

Tú eres puro, puro chantaje
Puro, puro chantaje
Vas libre como el aire

latin-songs	El Amante	Nicky Jam	8	3	3/18/2017	"Ya yo me cansé, no quiero ser tu amante
Te digo de mi parte que no aguanto más
Ya no aguanto ver el otro cómo dice que es el dueño tuyo
Me mata el orgullo, él ni te sabe hablar

Esta la hice pa' él
Cuando la escuche, quiero estar ahí para ver
Cuando se entere y sepa que soy dueño de usted
Tal vez suene un poco mal, lo sé, y no me luce
Todo es por usted

Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que con él te sientes fría

Mami, yo me siento tuyo
Yo sé que tú te sientes mía
Dile al noviecito tuyo
Que él es una porquería

Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más, más, más
Te caliento más

Sólo una cosa te preguntaré:
""Si tienes frío, ¿quién te da calor?""
Yo soy el dueño de tu fantasía

latin-songs	Subeme La Radio	"Enrique Iglesias Featuring Descemer Bueno, Zion & Lennox"	2	4	3/18/2017	"Súbeme la radio
Tra-tráeme el alcohol
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor

Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol
Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor

Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

Ya no me importa nada
Ni el día ni la hora
Si lo he perdido todo
Me has dejado en las sombras
Te juro que te pienso
Hago el mejor intento
El tiempo pasa lento
Y yo me voy muriendo
(Y yo me voy muriendo)

Si llega la noche y tú no contestas
Te juro me quedo esperando a tu puerta
Vivo pasando las noches en vela
Y sigo cantando bajo la luna llena

Súbeme la radio que esta es mi canción
Siente el bajo que va subiendo
Tráeme el alcohol que quita el dolor
Hoy vamos a juntar la luna y el sol

latin-songs	Adios Amor	Christian Nodal	18	5	3/18/2017	"Miro tus ojos y no eres feliz
y tu mirada no sabe mentir
No tiene caso continuar así
si no me amas es mejor partir
Desde hace tiempo ya nada es igual
no eres la misma y me tratas mal
y ante mi Dios te podría jurar
cuanto te quise y te quiero todavía
Adiós amor me voy de ti
y esta vez para siempre

latin-songs	Siempre Te Voy A Querer	Calibre 50	14	6	3/18/2017	"Me han preguntado que si tú eres mi verdadero amor
y yo
yo les digo es el amor de mi vida
Gracias por quererme como yo te quiero
No me veo sin ti y no te exagero
Y si a lo mejor no todo es perfecto pero
Pero se soluciona con besos
Igual que hago enojar
Hasta a veces llorar
Mas sabes que te amo y quiero que recuerdes esto

latin-songs	Heroe Favorito	Romeo Santos	4	7	3/18/2017	"Estoy planeando un secuestro
Para robarme tu amor
Mis estrategias no marchan
Y crece la imaginación

Vivo en un mundo ficticio
Con un solo compromiso

Conquistarte y darte toda mi atención
Pero tus padres te entregan
A otro hombre que apenas tu conoces
Y yo aquí sin solución

Yo quisiera ser el Hulk y te protejo
Superman para exhibirte el Universo
Si fuese Batman no habría noches de temor
La Baticueva nuestro nidito de amor

latin-songs	Reggaeton Lento (Bailemos)	CNCO	22	8	3/18/2017	"Qué bien se ve,
me trae loco su figura,
ese trajecito corto le queda bien,
combinado con su lipstick color café.

Qué bien se ve
me hipnotiza su cintura,
cuando baila hasta los dioses la quieren ver,
ya no perderé más tiempo, me acercaré.

Yo sólo la miré y me gustó,
me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?"",
la noche está para un reggaetón lento,
de esos que no se bailan hace tiempo.
Yo sólo la miré y me gustó,
me pegué y la invité: ""Bailemos, eh?"",
la noche está para un reggaetón lento,
de esos que no se bailan hace tiempo.

Permíteme bailar contigo esta pieza,
entre todas las mujeres se resalta tu belleza,
me encanta tu firmeza, te mueves con destreza,
muévete, muévete, muévete.

Muy rica, latina, estás llena de vida,
sube las dos manos, dale pa´ arriba.
¿Dónde están las solteras y las que no, también?
Sin miedo muévete, muévete, muévete.

Yo sólo la miré y me gustó,

(Precisamente en Cartagena)

Después de tanto, me buscas
¿Por qué será? ¿Por qué a mí? (yeah)
No te puedes ir sin contestar esa pregunta
¿Qué es lo que quieres?
¿Qué necesidad es la que tienes...?

Para seducirme otra vez
Besarme otra vez
Volverme a poner el mundo al revés
Pa' besarte como ayer
Sentirte otra vez
Me vuelves a poner el mundo al revés como ayer, yeah

El sólo verte me dan ganas de viajar al pasado y rescatar
Esos momentos que tú y yo compartimos
Las ganas de rumbear

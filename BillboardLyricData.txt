1	hot-holiday-songs	All I Want For Christmas Is You	Mariah Carey	30.0	1.0	2016-12-31	"I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own

Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you

There is just one thing I need
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own

You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya

She tied you to the kitchen chair

Hit the studio to body a verse

I just bought a car, cash money
I ain't even tryna brag on it
I just tell it how it really is
I ain't trippin', they ain't feelin' this
I ain't sayin' I deserve nothin'

Tryna keep the kitchen stocked

Nails scratchin' my back tatt
Eyes closed while you scream out
And you keep me in with those hips
While my teeth sink in those lips
While your body's giving me life
And you suffocate in my kiss
Then you said

Even when we're not together
Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
I want you forever

But I thought: ""How could I let you fall by yourself
While I'm wasted with someone else?""

If we go down, then we go down together
They'll say you could do anything
They'll say that I was clever
If we go down, then we go down together
We'll get away with everything
Let's show them we are better
Let's show them we are better

To get away from your parents
You look so proud
Standing there with a frown and a cigarette
Posting pictures of yourself on the internet
